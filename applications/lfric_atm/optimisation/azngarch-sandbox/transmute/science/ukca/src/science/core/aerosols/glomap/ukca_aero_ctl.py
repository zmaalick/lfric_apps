OMP CPU transform script for UKCA GLOMAP.

Provides:
    `trans(psyir)`: performs the OpenMP transformation of the main
      `ukca_aero_ctl` loop.

Rationale:
    GLOMAP processes are gridbox-independent. In the top-level GLOMAP
    subroutine (`ukca_aero_ctl`), the domain is chunked into segments. In order
    to maximise OpenMP coverage, the most efficient way to parallelise is by
    doing so over these chunks. Performance will vary depending on the size of
    the domain, and the user-specified chunk size (determined by
    `ukca_mode_seg_size` in the aerosol namelist).

Future work:
    Any changes to `ukca_aero_ctl` will possibly necessitate changes to the
    transformer.

    PSyclone as of version 3.1 is not capable of fully
    determining which variables need to be set PRIVATE, since many of these
    are arrays (and using `privatise_arrays` has not been found to work). The
    suggested fix from STFC is to use the `force_private` option.
    The workaround is to set anything beginning in `seg_` to PRIVATE, since
    these variables are the ones used in the chunking and therefore need to
    be private to each thread.

    An issue has been identified with PSyclone version 3.2:
    https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/issues/3173
    which causes the transformer to fail due to a bug where CodeBlocks did
    not have an `enters_scope` attribute. A fix is in progress at
    https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/tree/3173_quickfix.
