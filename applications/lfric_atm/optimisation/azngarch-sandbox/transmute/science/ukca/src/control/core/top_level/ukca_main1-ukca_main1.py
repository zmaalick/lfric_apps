# Summary
# =======
#
# This transformation is used to adjust the number of points passed to the ASAD
# initialisation routine to account for full-domain chunking.  The chunk size
# is taken at compile time from the environment variable UKCA_FULL_CHUNK_SIZE.
# If this variable is not set then the source code is passed through
# unmodified.
#
# Example
# =======
#
# Give the program
#
#   subroutine main()
#     if (ukca_config%l_ukca_asad_full) then
#       n_pnts = tot_n_pnts
#     endif
#   end subroutine
#
# and the parameters
#
#   match_if  = "ukca_config%l_ukca_asad_full"
#   match_lhs = "n_pnts"
#   match_rhs = "tot_n_pnts"
#   UKCA_FULL_CHUNK_SIZE = 256
#
# the following program is produced.
#
#   subroutine main()
#     if (ukca_config%l_ukca_asad_full) then
#       n_pnts = 256
#       umPrint("Initialising ASAD solver with 256 points")
#     end if
#   end subroutine

# Imports
# =======
