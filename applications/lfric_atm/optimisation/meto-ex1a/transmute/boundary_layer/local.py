'''
Local script for Boundary layer.
This by default removes the j loop(s) and replaces it with a init,
spans a PARALLEL region across the whole file,
and then adds OMP DO to the top most loop in each group of loops.
There are some small bespoke needs for the 6x files that this currently
affects which are captured below as they are initialised.

This is currently used by the following files:
* bl_lsp
* btq_int
* ex_flux_tq
* ex_flux_uv
* kmkh
* tr_mix
* imp_mix
* fm_drag
