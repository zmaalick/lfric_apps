"""
Optimisation script that adds OpenMP parallel do worksharing-loop directives.
The main loop requires dynamic schedule to improve load balancing between
threads. Some PSyclone dependency errors and a subroutine thread safety
check need to be overridden; these assignments and subroutine call can be
safely parallelised. Multiple arrays need to be declared OpenMP-private.
