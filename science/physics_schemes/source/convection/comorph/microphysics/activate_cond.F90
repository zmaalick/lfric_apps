! The rest of the code after this routine will only do anything
! at points where there is already non-zero condensate.
! To allow condensation to initiate, a minute amount of
! liquid cloud is seeded here.
! Note we don't fully condense to adjust the air to saturation here;
! this is because other processes maybe acting (e.g. freezing or melting)
! which could change the RH during the current timestep, so at this
! point we don't know how much condensation we need to do to adjust to
! saturation.  All the microphysical processes that affect T and q_vap
! (including condensation / evaporation of liquid-cloud) are solved
! simultaneously in phase_change_solve, so the adjustment to saturation
! is done in there.
! If the air actually ends up sub-saturated, the minute
! seeded condensate added here will just be re-evaporated without
! consequence.
! If we make this into a 2-moment scheme in the future,
! the activated number concentration should also be set here,
! based on the rate of increase of saturation and the
! modelled aerosols spectrum.
