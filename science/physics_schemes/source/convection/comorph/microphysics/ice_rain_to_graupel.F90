module ice_rain_to_graupel_mod

implicit none

contains

! Subroutine to convert collided ice and rain into graupel.
! This routine assumes that colection of rain by ice-cloud has
! already been computed, with the collided rain's mixing ratio
! added onto the ice.  It transfers the collided rain's mixing
! ratio into graupel instead, and additionally calculates the
! amount of ice-cloud involved in the collisions; this is also
! converted to graupel.

  ! We initially assume that all collisions between liquid and

  ! remelting some of it later (melting is treated implicitly
  ! within phase_change_solve).
  ! To get the appropriate remelting, a heat exchange
  ! coefficient for the graupel is required.  However, if we have
  ! just created graupel via rain-ice collisions at points where
  ! there was little or no graupel at the start of the step,
  ! the explicit heat exchange coef for graupel will be at or
  ! near zero, leading to remelting of all the graupel created.
