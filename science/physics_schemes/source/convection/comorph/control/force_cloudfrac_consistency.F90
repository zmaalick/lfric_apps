module force_cloudfrac_consistency_mod

implicit none

contains

! Subroutine to force the bulk cloud-fraction in a compressed
! fields array to be consistent with the liquid and ice
! cloud-fractions.  We must have:
!
! MAX(cf_liq,cf_ice) <= cf_bulk <= cf_liq+cf_ice
!
! If this law is broken, then attempts to calculate the
! mixed-phase and liquid-only cloud-fractions can yield
! spurious negative values.
! Various conversions of variables in CoMorph could potentially
! cause cf_bulk to go very slightly outside the above allowable
! range (e.g. rounding errors when converting the input
! cloud-fractions from 64-bit to 32-bit).
! This routine adjusts cf_bulk to force it to be within the
! above range.
