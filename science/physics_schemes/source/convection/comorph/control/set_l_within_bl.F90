module set_l_within_bl_mod

contains

! Subroutine to set flag for whether the current model-level
! (the theta-level, where the primary thermodynamic variables
! are defined) is within the boundary-layer.
! This is defined based on whether the model-level's lower
! and upper interfaces have any overlap with the boundary-layer
! top height passed in from the boundary-layer scheme.
