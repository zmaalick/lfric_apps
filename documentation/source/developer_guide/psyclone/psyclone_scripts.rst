================================================================
Adding a PSyclone transformation script for a specific module
================================================================

Adding a Python transformation script to target a module involves two steps:

1. Add the script to the correct location,
2. Add the name of the script/module (minus extension) to the correct variable
   in ``psyclone_transmute_file_list.mk``.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Adding a PSyclone transformation script to the correct location
----------------------------------------------------------------

Each Python transformation script must reside in a matching location to the
target source file as found in the **built** application.

Each Fortran source file to be transformed must use either
* A global transformation scipt, such as ``global.py`` , or
* A local transformation script, such as ``local.py`` (present in the
correspondingly named folder to the target file), or
* A **matching filename minus extension**, such as ``ls_ppn.py``.

See below for how to add a PSyclone transformation script for the ``ls_ppn.F90``
module.


Storing a global transformation script, ``global.py``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All files to be optimised by transmute (see ``psyclone_transmute_file_list.mk``)
will use this script unless overwritten with a ``local.py`` or if using a matching
filename. ::

    optimisation/
    └── <platform>/
        └── transmute/
            └── global.py


Storing a local transformation script, ``local.py``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All files to be optimised by transmute (see ``psyclone_transmute_file_list.mk``)
in the ``large_scale_precipitation`` directory will use this script unless overwritten
with a matching source filename.::

    optimisation/
    └── <platform>/
        └── transmute/
            └── large_scale_precipitation/
                └── local.py


For a script with matching source filename
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* The source file is found here **before** building - **This is NOT the path
  that should be used**::

    <LFRIC APPS>
    └── science/
        └── physics_schemes/
            └── source/
                └── large_scale_precipitation/
                    └── ls_ppn.F90


* To understand the required path for storing a matching source filename, the build directory of a built application should be consulted. In the **built** ``lfric_atm`` application, ``ls_ppn.F90`` is found here -
  **use this path**::

    <lfric_atm working directory>/
    └── large_scale_precipitation/
        └──ls_ppn.F90

* This module is not written in the PSyKAl format, so requires the ``transmute``
  method of operation.

Therefore, the transformation script for this module needs to be placed here
(note the matching filename)::

    optimisation/
    └── <platform>/
        └── transmute/
            └── large_scale_precipitation/
                └── ls_ppn.py

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding PSyclone transformation scripts to ``psyclone_transmute_file_list.mk``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of checking every module in the built application for a matching
PSyclone transformation script, each app maintains a list of modules on which to
apply module-specific PSyclone transformations. This can be found at::

    <application>
    └── build/
      └── psyclone_transmute_file_list.mk

Within this makefile there are several environment variables which control the
how files are passed to PSyclone Transmute.
These are:

* ``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_FILES``
* ``PSYCLONE_PASS_NO_SCRIPT``
* ``TRANSMUTE_INCLUDE_METHOD``
* ``PSYCLONE_DIRECTORIES``
* ``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_EXCEPTION``


``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_FILES`` is used with ``TRANSMUTE_INCLUDE_METHOD`` ``specify_include``.
File names (without file extensions), which are to be affected by PSyclone, are
added to this list. Any files not included in this list will not be processed by
PSyclone.
A PSyclone transformation script is applied to each respective file.
The ``global.py`` script is used as the default transformation script, overridden by file- or directory-specific alternatives as detailed above.
This is currently the default method for enabling PSyclone transformation scripts for
source files.

``PSYCLONE_PASS_NO_SCRIPT`` has been implemented for the ``TRANSMUTE_INCLUDE_METHOD``
``specify_include``. Use of this variable for the ``specify_exclude`` method is not mature,
however this could be expanded to exclude in the future (see `issue319 <https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps/issues/319>`_,).
This variable specifies files to be passed to PSyclone without applying any transformations.
This can be useful to remove existing clauses from a file without otherwise modifying the Fortran source.
Any files included in ``PSYCLONE_PASS_NO_SCRIPT`` are filtered out of the ``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_FILES`` list,
and sent to a separate make script.

``TRANSMUTE_INCLUDE_METHOD`` can be set to either ``specify_include`` or
``specify_exclude``.
With ``specify_include``, ``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_FILES`` will be used to define the list
of files to be passed to the PSyclone Transmute command, and only these files will be
passed. All other Fortran source files will not be passed to PSyclone.

When using ``specify_exclude``, a list of target directories is passed via
``PSYCLONE_DIRECTORIES``. For all directories in this list, every Fortran source file
found in these directories will be passed to PSyclone. To omit a file from being passed
to PSyclone, the filename (including extension) can be added to
``PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_EXCEPTION``. This can often be used with .h files currently.


Module/transformation script names should be added in the following style (in
accordance with GNUMake)::

    PSYCLONE_PHYSICS_FILES = \
    ls_ppn \
    lsp_taper_ndrop \
    mphys_air_density_mod

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding PSyclone Transmute transformation functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transformation optimisation scripts for Transmute, should be kept clean and
simple much like the existing PSyKAl scripts,
Ref: ``applications/lfric_atm/optimisation/meto-ex1a/psykal/global.py``

Functions should exist in their own Python script bucket(s) for Transmute,
like in PSyKAl in LFRic Core. Where this bucket is located is a WIP, but for
now will be here
``interfaces/physics_schemes_interface/build/psyclone_transmute``.
In the longer term, most may be held in the PSyTran repository, with
the intention to reduce code duplication
here: `PSyTran <https://github.com/MetOffice/PSyTran>`_.

It is recommended for developers at this time to use the following process.

* Generate an LFRic Apps ticket to drive the work.
* Put script functions in a PSyclone folder in the Apps ticket here
  ``interfaces/physics_schemes_interface/build/psyclone_transmute``.
* The Python path in the ``psyclone_transmute.mk`` file may need to updated
  with this path.
* Where existing script files and functions exist, please utilise them.
* Top-level calls to these functions should occur in the transmute
  optimisation folder in the application, ``lfric_atm`` and ``ngarch``.
* Start a PSyTran issue to try and get duplicate code removed and new
  code reviewed.
* Copy down any PSyTran code used, where the duplicated code has been
  removed in the Apps ticket so we have a local copy of the code from PSyTran,
  with a comment in the Apps ticket and PSyTran issue.
* Currently PSyTran is not integrated into the build system.
* Link this ticket
  `issue320 <https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps/issues/320>`_,
  and update it with the functions duplicated to capture technical debt.
