Available Functions for Optimisation Scripts
============================================

There are a number of transformations provided by Psyclone that can be used for
optimisation. These are listed in the Psyclone documentation
`here <https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/transformations.html>`__.
To reduce the amount of boiler-plate code, a few useful tranformations have
been aggregated and applied in convenient functions specific to LFRic in a
``psyclone_tools.py`` file that resides in LFRic Core. These functions are
described below.

---------------------------------
Profiling using ``profile_loops``
---------------------------------

Using the ``profile_loops`` function allows the user to wrap the outermost loop
around a coded kernel with a set of timing calipers. This function utilises the
``ProfileTrans`` transformation that allows psyclone to inject a set of timing
calipers and employ which ever profiling software is being used in conjunction
with LFRic. The function takes a psyir node as an essential argument. As an
optional argument, a ``colours_only`` bool can be used to profile only kernels
that use coloured ordering. This argument is True by default but when set to
False, every coded kernel instance will be profiled. An example that can be
included in either the ``global.py`` or a specific algorithm file is below.


.. code-block:: python

   from psyclone_tools import profile_loops

   def trans(psyir):
       profile_loops(psyir,colours_only=False)


An important thing to note when including this function in an optimisation
script is its position relative to other transformation functions.
The ``profile_loops`` function must come after the ``colour_loops`` function
but before the ``openmp_parallelise_loops`` function. This ensures that the
callipers are injected into the correct position in the Psyclone generated code.
The build step will fail gracefully if this function is used out of order.
